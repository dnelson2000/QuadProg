# QuadProg
Quadratic programming with nonlinear constraints is a basic tool in many areas of graphics and interaction, and machine learning (Support Vector Machines).

We are able to replicate matlab's 'quadprog' route results to all 16 digits folloing the algorithm  of their interior-point-convex quadratic programming algorithm

without the need for the optimization toolbox.
